# Introduction

## Project Overview 

This project is an alert system that sends real-time NBA game day score notifications to subscribed users via SMS/Email. It leverages Amazon SNS, AWS Lambda and Python, Amazon EvenBridge and NBA APIs to provide sports fans with up-to-date game information. The project demonstrates cloud computing principles and efficient notification mechanisms.

# Background

## Amazon SNS 

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a fully managed messaging service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It facilitates communication between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications by enabling message delivery across multiple channels.

## AWS Lambda 

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, you simply upload your code, and AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance.

## Amazon EventBridge 

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service provided by AWS that helps you integrate applications using events. It enables you to connect applications across AWS services, third-party SaaS applications, and your custom applications. EventBridge simplifies building event-driven architectures by routing events based on pre-defined rules to targets such as AWS Lambda, Step Functions, Amazon SQS.

## Amazon CloudWatch 

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to help you collect, analyze, and act on data and metrics from your AWS resources, applications, and services in real-time. 

## PythonBoto3 

Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It enables Python developers to interact programmatically with AWS services, making it easier to build, manage, and automate cloud-based applications and resources. 

## NBA API

NBA APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are services that provide access to basketball-related data and functionalities from the National Basketball Association (NBA). These APIs are widely used by developers to build applications, websites, or data analysis tools centered around NBA content. Such as Live game scores and updates and Game schedules and results.
